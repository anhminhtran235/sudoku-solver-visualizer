# sudoku-solver-visualizer
I learned Javascript, HTML and CSS in only 2 weeks and then I started this project right away.
The code of this project is quite messy. If you want to see cleaner codes of mine, please check out other projects on my Github.
I also deploy this code to the web. Please check it out here: https://anhminhtran235.github.io/sudoku-solver-visualizer/
